# Simple E-Commerce App

This is a simple e-commerce app made for an interview process.

It is very simple because of time constraints. 
Any login you create that is not an existing login will be automatically created in the database.
However, if you try to login in with an existing username, it must have the previous password.

This app uses MERN stack, and stores the products, users, and carts in a Mongo DB.
